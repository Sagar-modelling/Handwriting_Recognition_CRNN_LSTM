# Handwriting_Recognition_CRNN_LSTM
In this notebook, we'll go through the steps to train a CRNN (CNN+RNN) model for handwriting recognition. The model will be trained using the CTC(Connectionist Temporal Classification) loss function
# Why Deep Learning?

Deep Learning self extracts features with a deep neural networks and classify itself. Compare to traditional Algorithms it performance increase with Amount of Data.
## Methodology.
The handwriting recognition model which takes a line as input and converts the line into digital text. This model consits of a CNN-biLSTM architecture. The loss used is the CTC (Connectionist Temporal Classification) loss.
